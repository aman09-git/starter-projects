# 🚀 Starter Projects – Cloud & DevOps (Evolving Repository)

This repository contains a set of **starter-level Cloud and DevOps projects** created as part of my **hands-on learning journey**.

The objective of this repository is to practice **core AWS and DevOps fundamentals**, understand real-world architectures, and gradually evolve these projects with better automation, monitoring, and best practices.

This is an **actively evolving repository** — projects will be refined, enhanced, and new ones will be added over time as learning progresses.
